        <p>Anime is known for its distinct style, which is characterized by colorful, detailed animation and unique character designs. However, anime can be broken down into several different categories, including shōnen, shōjo and seinen. Shōnen anime is aimed at young boys and features action, adventure and comedy.</p>
        <h2>Dragon Ball</h2>
        <p>Dragon Ball tells the tale of a young warrior by the name of Son Goku, a young peculiar boy with a tail who embarks on a quest to become stronger and learns of the Dragon Balls, when, once all 7 are gathered, grant any wish of choice.</p>
        <ul>
           <li>While this can be considered to be an open secret among fans of the series, most Western fans tend to forget that Dragon Ball drew most of its influences from the classic Chinese story, Journey to the West.</li>
            <li>Dragon Ball first started as a gag comic, and Akira used some of its gags in Dragon Ball Z. Kakarot, Raditz, and Vegeta got their names after vegetables.</li>
            <li>Here’s a fact that many fans argue about: Dragon Ball Z character Goku resembles Superman. Both are aliens. Both are only survivors of their race. Both are one of the strongest in their universes. Both are fighting for a good cause.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>Tokyo Ghoul follows the story of Ken Kaneki who lives in an alternate reality where ghouls roam the earth in disguise as normal humans. They hunt down humans and eat their flesh in order to survive and satisfy their hunger. Tokyo Ghoul was one hell of dark anime that left a lot of stories to tell. So here we are taking a look back at some of the facts that intrigue us the most about the popular horror anime.

</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In Tokyo there are actually districts that are like neighborhoods, there are only 23 of them while in the anime there are 24</li>
